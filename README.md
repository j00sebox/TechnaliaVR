## Synopsis

You crashland on an island inhabited by a mad scientist and his many inventions. Explore the island using gadgets you find in order to make it home.

## Gameplay

Right now this is only a protoype so there is limited features that are currently implemented. 

### Freeze Ray

The terrain is generated with the Unity Terrain Tools package. The player can modify this terrain at runtime by using the freeze ray to add the ice texture to the scene. If the player steps on the ice they will gain momentum and they can use this momentum to make jumps they otherwise couldn't. The player will also need to use the freeze ray in order to complete certain tasks.
