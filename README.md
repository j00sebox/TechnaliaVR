The terrain is generated with the Unity Terrain Tools package. The player can modify this terrain at runtime by using the freeze ray to add the ice texture to the scene. If the player steps on the ice they will gain momentum and they can use this momentum to make jumps they otherwise couldn't. The player will also need to use the freeze ray in order to complete certain tasks.
