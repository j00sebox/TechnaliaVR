Technalia

A game by Jonathan Cockfield and Josh Armstrong made with Unity

You crashland on an island inhabited by a mad scientist and his many inventions. Explore the island using gadgets you find in order to make it home.

For the final version we have included 3 gadgets that the player will collect as they progress through the game.

Freeze Ray:

The freeze ray is the first of these gadgets the player can find. By aiming and shooting at the terrain the player can place ice, by running or walking over that ice the player can
gain momentum and speed. This is useful for getting around or for making it over jumps that the player can't make otherwise. The freeze ray can also be used to freeze certain 
objects that is needed to overcome some obstacles. 

Spring Boots:

The spring boots allow the player to reach higher areas by holding and then releasing the space bar. The longer the player holds the space bar the higher they will jump up to a
certain point. 

Web Cannon:

The web cannon shoots a web ball projectile that will splatter a web when it hits the terrain. When the player comes into contact with a web they will be unable to move. To get
out of the web a player can use the spring boots to charge up a jump to escape.

Diary Entries:

The mad scientist has left pages of his dairy scattered throughout the island. These can give insight into the scientist's backstory and also provide hints about what the gadgets
can be used for.

Drones:

Some of the scientist's creations have gone haywire. There will be drones blocking the player's way that they must avoid in order to get past.

How to Run:

In the Builds folder there is an executable named Technalia.exe. It is a binary built for PC platforms. When the game starts you will be greeted with the title screen, press start to begin the game.

Controls:

Once you are in the game you can enter the pause menu with the escape key. Once the menu appears you can click the controls button to view the list of controls.

Enjoy!
